    "### Project Goals\n",
    "The goal of this project is to help DCS users to browse the ever growing campaign DLC list and recommend \n",
    "appropriate campaigns for their next purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial version of the recommender will be based on a NLP implementation using solely the product info provided on \n",
    "DCS WORLD website (just like how a user receives info), with collaborative filtering added later when data becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will first extract product info from [DCS-WORLD.com](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com) and\n",
    "save as csv file form, ready for general analysis and other product usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the data on `dcs_recommender`, one first need to clean unnecessary text parts and concatenate text to form 'tags' column, a **clean** csv with proper tags aggregated is needed for `dcs_recommender` to process.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:\n",
    "- Can the recommender accurately recommend topic related/author related campaign (content based)?\n",
    "- How are those results compared to a *veteran player recommendation*?\n",
    "- How can the recommender take in other domain knowledges that *veteran players* are aware of (such as gameplay quality, type of missions within, mission length, etc.) ?\n",
    "- Will `dcs_recommender` perform better than the current *popular* recommendation presented on DCS website in sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The base product info was provided by [DCS-WORLD.com](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "*future purchase related data may be added from Eagle Dynamics*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For v0.1, the simple NLP implementation, `dcs_recommender` is able to recommend campaigns that are strongly related in true content, such as *training campaigns*, *Red Flag campaigns*, and *campaigns with same author* (author names are not included in the tags, so this is actually amazing!)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some siginificant downsides. Since `dcs_recommender` recommends compaigns that date years before and the campaign's build and production quality are simply not comparable to recent ones. Needless to say that old campaigns may be filled with bugs and being poorly maintained, giving players a poor experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "To alleviate this issue, I will add weightings based on campaign publishing date, Steam user reviews and other public available data. The result should favor less on older, more negatively reviewed campaigns, thus completing the 'content filtering' part of the recommender.\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect the model to perform fairly well once 'collaborative filtering' is added, and will present to DCS veteran player groups for evaluation before the official launch."
